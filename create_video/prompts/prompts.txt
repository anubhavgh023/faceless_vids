A knight in shiny silver armor rides a black horse, entering a misty, dense forest with glowing lanterns
The knight encounters a mysterious figure with a glowing staff in the dark forest, trees looming around
The knight battles a fearsome red dragon on the edge of a rocky cliff, flames and sparks filling the air
The knight rests by a fire, his armor reflecting the flames, the battle-worn sword lying nearby
The knight returns to a grand castle at dawn, the sun rising behind tall towers
