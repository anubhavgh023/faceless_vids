1
0:00:00,0600 --> 0:00:00,5200
As the

2
0:00:00,5200 --> 0:00:01,2000
storm clouds

3
0:00:01,2000 --> 0:00:02,3200
gather ominously

4
0:00:02,3200 --> 0:00:03,0200
on the

5
0:00:03,0200 --> 0:00:04,0800
distant horizon

6
0:00:05,0600 --> 0:00:05,3000
casting the

7
0:00:05,3000 --> 0:00:06,0400
once bright

8
0:00:06,0400 --> 0:00:06,7800
sky into

9
0:00:06,7800 --> 0:00:07,3800
the muted

10
0:00:07,3800 --> 0:00:08,2800
palette of

11
0:00:08,2800 --> 0:00:09,2000
grey and

12
0:00:09,2000 --> 0:00:09,9800
violet the

13
0:00:09,9800 --> 0:00:10,5000
air took

14
0:00:10,5000 --> 0:00:11,1800
an electric

15
0:00:11,1800 --> 0:00:12,9200
charge Thick

16
0:00:12,9200 --> 0:00:13,6200
with the

17
0:00:13,6200 --> 0:00:14,0600
promise of

18
0:00:14,0600 --> 0:00:14,9600
rain a

19
0:00:14,9600 --> 0:00:15,7400
single rumble

20
0:00:15,7400 --> 0:00:16,4800
of thunder

21
0:00:16,4800 --> 0:00:17,3200
echoed across

22
0:00:17,3200 --> 0:00:17,8400
the valley

23
0:00:18,9200 --> 0:00:19,3600
stirring birds

24
0:00:19,3600 --> 0:00:20,0800
from their

25
0:00:20,0800 --> 0:00:21,2999
perches And

26
0:00:21,2999 --> 0:00:21,7400
a moment

27
0:00:21,7400 --> 0:00:23,1600
later fat

28
0:00:23,1600 --> 0:00:24,0600
Randolph began

29
0:00:24,0600 --> 0:00:24,6399
to fall

30
0:00:25,5200 --> 0:00:26,2999
drumming softly

31
0:00:26,2999 --> 0:00:26,7400
on the

32
0:00:26,7400 --> 0:00:27,7999
rooftop and

33
0:00:27,7999 --> 0:00:28,5800
turning dust

34
0:00:28,5800 --> 0:00:29,3600
into slick

35
0:00:29,3600 --> 0:00:30,5400
ribbons while

36
0:00:30,5400 --> 0:00:31,2000
people hurried

37
0:00:31,2000 --> 0:00:31,9200
for shelters

38
0:00:31,9200 --> 0:00:32,7000
under awnings

39
0:00:32,7000 --> 0:00:33,6600
and the

40
0:00:33,6600 --> 0:00:34,7400
atmosphere shifted

41
0:00:34,7400 --> 0:00:35,4599
to one

42
0:00:35,4599 --> 0:00:36,0200
of calm

43
0:00:37,0200 --> 0:00:37,4399
The sounds

44
0:00:37,4399 --> 0:00:38,2000
of raindrops

45
0:00:38,2000 --> 0:00:39,2599
created a

46
0:00:39,2599 --> 0:00:39,7999
soothing backdrop

47
0:00:39,7999 --> 0:00:40,6199
to the

48
0:00:40,6199 --> 0:00:41,0600
hustle of

49
0:00:41,0600 --> 0:00:41,6399
those seeking

50
0:00:41,6399 --> 0:00:43,0999
refuge The

51
0:00:43,0999 --> 0:00:43,7200
storm seemed

52
0:00:43,7200 --> 0:00:44,1399
to bring

53
0:00:44,1399 --> 0:00:44,8400
a strange

54
0:00:44,8400 --> 0:00:45,9800
sense of

55
0:00:45,9800 --> 0:00:46,5200
peace amidst

56
0:00:46,5200 --> 0:00:47,0800
the chaos

57
0:00:48,1800 --> 0:00:49,2599
Outside the

58
0:00:49,2599 --> 0:00:50,2599
world transformed

59
0:00:50,2599 --> 0:00:51,0600
as puddles

60
0:00:51,0600 --> 0:00:52,1399
formed and

61
0:00:52,1399 --> 0:00:52,5600
the scent

62
0:00:52,5600 --> 0:00:53,1199
of wet

63
0:00:53,1199 --> 0:00:53,7999
earth filled

64
0:00:53,7999 --> 0:00:54,2400
the air

65
0:00:54,8800 --> 0:00:55,7000
This was

66
0:00:55,7000 --> 0:00:56,2400
the rhythmic

67
0:00:56,2400 --> 0:00:57,0999
lullabies of

68
0:00:57,0999 --> 0:00:57,9599
Summer Downpours
